    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> On December 30th, 2019, the first cases of COVID-19 
        were reported in China by doctor in Wuhan. That doctor, 
        Li Wenliang, tried to warn the world of the impending 
        catastrophe, but was silenced by his authoritarian 
        government. Two months later, he and thousands 
        of others had succumbed to the virus. As COVID-19 
        spread, the world slowly realized it's threat, and 
        went on full lockdown. Ports and borders were closed, 
        workers were asked to stay home, and much of the global 
        economy was shuttered. In the months following the 
        outbreak of COVID-19, much has been said on how it will 
        affect the economy. This analysis will invert this trend 
        and look at if the size of a country's economy impacts the 
        spread of COVID-19. This analysis looks at both Infection and Mortality 
        Rates for countries around the world, comparing these to each 
        country's GDP. Use the links above for an in-depth look at both variables.</p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>The data for this analysis is all taken from kaggle.com. Much of the data 
    has been sheared down, as many countries don't have available information on 
    relevant data such as population or GDP. Each dataset is linked below.</p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>These visuals analyze available GDP, Infection Rate, 
        and Mortality Rate data to determine whether there 
        is a correlation between the size of a country's 
        economy and it's overall reaction to COVID-19. 
        I chose to analyze this data to determine whether 
        or not countries that were more active in the 
        global economy were hit harder by COVID-19.
        Both the bar charts and the scatterplots show 
        that there is no significant relationship between 
        GDP, Infection Rate, and Mortality Rate, at least 
        with currently available data.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>There are many interesting limitations on this 
        data, and many more dynamics that will change 
        the scope and outcome of this analysis in the 
        future. As scientists collect more data, they 
        are realizing that many more people than 
        previously suspected have already been exposed 
        to COVID-19. This means that the data for cases 
        is a low-end estimate of the actual number of 
        cases. In reality, due to a pervasive lack of 
        testing in many countries, including the United 
        States, we will never know the actual Infection 
        or even Mortality Rates. Moreover, the world is 
        witnessing political falsification of data for 
        multiple reasons, including saving face for the 
        incumbent regime. China is strongly suspected 
        of underreporting cases and deaths from the 
        virus. In terms of the specific datasets that 
        were used in this analysis, there are also 
        important limitations. For example, many 
        countries do not have available GDP data for 
        the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. Accordingly, 
        this analysis uses GDP data from 2017. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, this project attempts to analyze 
        a potential relationship between GDP and COVID-19 
        Infection and Mortality Rates. The attempt was 
        greatly hindered by numerous limitations on the 
        data, including lack of testing, political corruption, 
        and failure to report current GDP data. As a result, 
        it is difficult to draw accurate conclusions at 
        this time. What we can say is that the data available 
        shows no correlation between GDP, Infection Rate, 
        and Mortality Rate. This conclusion could change 
        dramatically as better data becomes available. In 
        terms of this analysis and the world, the future 
        is uncertain.</p>
